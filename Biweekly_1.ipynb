        "This is looking at the data set of the starwars characters wich shows the name, height, mass, hair color, skin color, eye color, birth year, gender and a few other details. I only wanted to look at the height, weight, name and gender of the characters, so the 3rd line selects only that. The weight was changed from \"weight\" to \"mass\" and the height was converted from cm to m. The column of \"male\" and \"female\" was simplified to \"m\" or \"f\". In the character list there was also droids and alien species so those had to be omited from the new table. Finaly the characters where classified as \"big\" or \"small\" depending on their mass and height; if they were more than 75 kg or taller than 1.7 m then they were considered big.\n",
